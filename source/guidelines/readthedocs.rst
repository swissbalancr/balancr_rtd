Every team member is encouraged to contribute to the "Read the Docs" technical documentation whose Git repository on GitHub is called `balancr_rtd <https://github.com/swissbalancr/balancr_rtd>`_. 

Creating a new version should be done as soon as possible and may involve:

- correcting the documentation

    - updating a value
    - fixing a mistake
    

- extending the documentation

    - adding a missing piece of information in an existing section
    - creating a new section.
